# Chapter7 Monitoring and Managing Linux Processes

### What is a process?
- A process is a program which is being executed
- Any process may create a child process. All processes are descendants of the first system process, which is systemd on a RHEL7 system.
```
[root@master ~]# echo $$ # Display the PID (process ID) of the current shell
4085

[root@master ~]# bash # Open a new shell (a subprocess within the current root)

[root@master ~]# echo $$ # Display the PID of the new shell (note that the number has changed because it is a different process)
8686

[root@master ~]# exit # Exit the subshell and return to the original shell
exit

[root@master ~]# echo $$ # Return to the original shell; the old PID appears again
4085

üîπ Quick explanation:
Each time you open a new shell (for example, by typing bash), a new process is created with a unique PID. When you exit, it returns to the original process.
The echo $$ command helps you find the running process number, which is useful for tracking the shell or dealing with temporary processes and tasks.

### Listing processes:
```
[root@master ~]# ps              # Display only processes associated with the current shell
[root@master ~]# ps aux          # Display all processes in the system in detail
[root@master ~]# ps -aux         # Same as above (syntactically incorrect, but works on some systems)
[root@master ~]# ps -aux | less  # Display long results using less for easy browsing

[root@master ~]# ps aux | grep -i syslogd   # Search for a process whose name contains syslogd (case-insensitive)
[root@master ~]# ls /proc/                  # Browse the process directory on the system (each process has a directory with a PID number)
[root@master ~]# ps aux | grep 264          # Search for process number 264 (which you might see in the /proc folder)
[root@master ~]# pidof vim                  # Display the PID of vim (if running)
# OR
[root@master ~]# pgrep vim                 # Alternative to pidof: Searches for processes named vim and displays the PID

[root@master ~]# ps -l        # Display process information, including PPID (Parent Process ID)
[root@master ~]# ps -ef       # Display all processes with PPID and niceness (process priority value)

## Symbol explanation:

# a: Display all processes associated with the terminal
# u: Additional display of columns such as user and runtime
# x: Display processes that are not associated with the terminal (e.g., background processes)

[root@master ~]# pstree       # Display processes in a tree
# OR
[root@master ~]# ps fax       # Alternative method for displaying processes in a tree
[root@master ~]# pstree -p    # Display processes in tree form with PID next to each process

```
Processes in brackets (usually at the top) are scheduled kernel threads.

## Real-time process monitoring:

```
[root@master ~]# uptime     # Display the current time, system uptime, number of users, and load average

[root@master ~]# grep "model name" /proc/cpuinfo     # To find out the number and types of CPUs on the machine


[root@master ~]# top        # An interactive tool to display running processes and resource consumption in real time
üéõÔ∏è While running the top command, you can use the following commands:

type 1 ‚Üí Display all CPU cores
type s ‚Üí Change the default refresh rate (3 seconds)
type h ‚Üí Display top's help instructions
type k ‚Üí Kill a process using the PID number
type r ‚Üí Change the process priority (renice)
type M ‚Üí Sort processes by memory consumption
type P ‚Üí Sort processes by CPU consumption
type n ‚Üí Specify the number of processes displayed
type w ‚Üí Save the current setting as the default
type q ‚Üí Exit the top tool

üßæ Explanation of the important columns in the top:

PID   ‚Üí Process ID
USER  ‚Üí Username of the user who owns the process
VIRT  ‚Üí Virtual memory used by the process (including swap)
RES   ‚Üí Physical memory (RAM) used without swap
TIME  ‚Üí Total time the process has used the processor since its start

```

### üñ•Ô∏è GUI Tools to Manage Processes:
```
[root@master ~]# gnome-system-monitor # A graphical tool for monitoring processes and resource consumption (similar to Task Manager in Windows)

Or via the graphical path:

Applications ‚Üí System Tools ‚Üí System Monitor # to access the tool from the GNOME interface

```
---

### Controlling Jobs:
- Background processes display a question mark (?) in the TTY column in a ps aux command.

```
[root@master ~]# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null
[root@master ~]# sleep 100000 &               (Running a job in the background)
[1] 5151

[root@master ~]# jobs
[1]+  Running       sleep 100000 &

[root@master ~]# fg %1
sleep 100000

^Z                                    (To resend to the background)
[1]+  Stopped       sleep 100000

[root@master ~]# bg %1                (To restart the process in the background)              
[1]+ sleep 100000 &

OR
[root@master ~]# bg 5151

^C                                    (End the process)
```
---
### Killing Processes:
```
[root@master ~]# kill -l       # Display all available kill signals
[root@master ~]# man 7 signal  # Display a guide explaining the function of each signal

# Most important signals:
1) SIGHUP ‚Üí Requests the process to reread the configuration files
9) SIGKILL ‚Üí Kills the process directly (cannot be ignored), use with caution
15) SIGTERM ‚Üí The default signal, requests that the process be terminated gently

[root@master ~]# pidof vim   # Get the PID of the vim application
4123
[root@master ~]# kill 4123   # Kill the process using the default signal (SIGTERM 15)

[root@master ~]# pidof vim   # Check if the process is still running
7073

[root@master ~]# kill -9 7073         # Forcefully kill the process using SIGKILL
[root@master ~]# kill -SIGKILL 7073   # Same command in a different form

[root@master ~]# pkill vim     # Kill all processes named "vim" (using SIGTERM by default)
[root@master ~]# killall vim   # Kill all processes associated with vim
```
---
### Managing Process Priorities:
- Processes are scheduled according to priority.
- negative values are allowed only to root.
```
[root@master ~]# ps l # Display the list of processes with the nice value for each process
```
-The nice command is used to start a process with a user defined priority.

```
üü¢ Use nice to set a priority when starting a process :

[root@master ~]# nice vim text & # Run vim with nice priority = 10 (default)
[1] 9182

[root@master ~]# nice -n 15 vim text & # Run vim with a lower priority (nice = 15), i.e., a slower execution priority

üîÑ Use renice to change the priority of an already running process:

[root@master ~]# renice 19 9182 # Change the priority of the process with PID 9182 to nice = 19

```
